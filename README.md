Boilerplate for PHP OOP Login &amp; Authentication

The original & inital commit of this is based on the lengthy PHP OOP authentication tutorial by PHP Academy (which I did step-by-step, and used for another project).

Now, I am in the process of making my own modifications on the front-end and upgrading with more advanced features, javascript libraries and PHP 7. Future checkins will be my modifications. 

Although I am mostly currently doing React and Node.js work, I have seen some need for PHP authentication upgrades, so I'm hoping this will be helpful to somebody and/or my potential clients.
